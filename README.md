# Cosmic-Reach-Unofficial-Mac-Launcher
A launcher for the game "Cosmic Reach" intended to make it easier to update &amp; launch on macOS.

# Use case
This launcher was made to fix a problem: Cosmic Reach on mac has to be opened via a jar file, which can't be easily opened in spotlight search, and the itch.io app can't install it automatically. This launcher fixes both of these things!

# Features
- Simple UI which looks native to macOS
- Launch the game easily from the launcher
- Update the game automatically, with one click!
- Multi-version support is currently not implimented, but maybe in the future I'll add it if there is enough people wanting it.

# Usage
Install the latest build on the right, and it's as simple as opening Cosmic Reach Mac Launcher.app!

When you open it for the first time, a log window will appear to display status updates while it downloads Cosmic Reach for you. Eventually, the log window will disappear and the launcher will open.

# Credits
This project is made possible by a small project called **itch-dl** (https://github.com/DragoonAethis/itch-dl), which allows for easy downloading of itch.io games.
